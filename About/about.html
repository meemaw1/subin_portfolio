				Hi I'm Subin
			</div>
					
			<div  id="pbs" class="subtitle">
				Overview
			</div>
			<div class="description">
				Welcome to my life's case study ðŸ˜„ <br />
				I am a computer science undergrad from Kerala, currently pursuing a degree in b.tech which is currently on hold due to the lockdown. I like sketching, listening to music and gaming.
			</div>
			<div  id="pbs" class="subtitle">
				How did it all begin ?
			</div>
			<div class="description">
				I have always had a thing for art, though my parents wanted me to pursue engineering. And So I gave the exams, and enrolled in an engineering college in Kerala, hoping to dig up some opportunities in 4 years. It took me some days to adapt to the new language and culture. However It wasn't long before people started recognizing me as an artist, and I got to make acquaintances with them.

			<div  id="pbs" class="subtitle">
				How did I get into UI Design ?
			</div>
			<div class="description">
				I was a very active student, partaking in college management teams, contests, and pretty much in everything I could put my artistic skills into. It was around my second semester that I learned about front end development. This seemed a nice way to continue my longing for art, keeping in touch with my course plan. My friends found potential in me and introduced me to freelancing, and so I gave a shot at it.   
			</div>
			<div  id="pbs" class="subtitle">
				How did I grow as a self taught Designer ?
			</div>
			<div class="description">
				My early days as a freelancer were terrible. No one would hire me as I had no reviews or stars up my sleeves. Not even a single work to showcase. I realized the only way around this, was to participate in open freelance contests. For 1 whole year, I tried but got nothing. But I was simply too stubborn to give up. So, like a true sportsman, I embraced my failures, revised my mistakes, and kept striving for success. I participated avidly on various platforms like Codepen and Freelancer.com, all so I could be a part of a larger community to learn, grow, and expand my network. 
			</div>
			<div  id="pbs" class="subtitle">
				My experience...
			</div>
			<div class="description">
				After a struggle of 1.3 years I finally got my first break as a freelancer from a startup based in Canada JABT labs. Impressed by my work on Codepen I was invited to review their product. Eventually, as my work got better and better, I started getting more freelance job offers online, and I could see my hardships finally pay off in the end ðŸ˜Š
			</div>
			<div  id="pbs" class="subtitle">
				From noob to pro !
			</div>
			<div class="description">
				It's immature to call oneself a pro. But looking at my past, struggling to make a mark in this competitive world, I'm simply proud to boast a little. Afterall a little motivation is what gives us the urge to do better in life, and I found plenty in 4 years.
			</div>
			<div  id="pbs" class="subtitle">
				What next ?
			</div>
			<div id="last_description" class="description">
				I got an offer as a decision scientist in Musigma. However, I declined it only to look for chances as a UI Designer. My parents were reluctant about my decision, but my brother always believed in me and my potential. Unfortunately job opportunities are on an all-time low amid the virus outbreak. However, I've only learned to learn from my failures, and here I am, talking to you as you read my little blog. Maybe you could give me my spark :)
